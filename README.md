# Uncommon HTML Attribute Access Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle but uncommon error that can occur when working with HTML attributes.  Specifically, it highlights the potential issue of attempting to access an attribute that may not exist on an element.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect approach, while `bugSolution.html` demonstrates the proper way to handle potentially missing attributes.  This often overlooked practice can prevent unexpected null or undefined errors in JavaScript code interacting with the DOM.
